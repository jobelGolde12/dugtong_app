In @app/chatbot.tsx, improve the overall user experience of the chatbot with the following enhancements:

1. Human-like Chatbot Voice

Make the AI chatbot’s responses sound more natural, conversational, and humanistic.

Avoid robotic or overly formal phrasing.

Use friendly tone, natural pauses, and casual expressions where appropriate.

2. AI Chat Bubble UI

Add a chat bubble style to the AI’s messages, similar to the user’s chat bubble.

Position the AI bubble on the opposite side of the user’s messages.

Ensure consistent padding, rounded corners, and spacing for readability.

3. Microphone Icon Animation

Add a subtle bounce animation to the circular microphone icon.

The animation should:

Trigger when the mic is active or listening

Be smooth and non-distracting

Loop gently (e.g., scale or vertical bounce)

4. Visual Consistency

Ensure animations and chat bubbles match the existing design system.

Keep transitions smooth and performance-friendly.
