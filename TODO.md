In @app/search.tsx, refactor the UI by extracting the available donor cards into a separate, reusable component.

Important constraints:

Only separate the donor card UI into its own component

Do not modify, remove, or refactor any logic, styles, imports, or code that are not directly related to this donor card separation

Preserve all existing behavior, props, and data flow

Ensure the new component is properly imported and used in search.tsx
